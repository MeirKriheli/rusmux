# Rusmux - tmux automation

The main purpose of this project is to serve as a substitute for [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator), while still utilizing its yaml files. 

`tmuxinator`, which is written in Ruby, has had instances of breaking due to updates in packages/gems, 
having me scrambling for  a solution. 

Furthermore, the process of installing it on different servers that lack a Ruby installation proved to be tedious.

Hence, [rusmux](https://github.com/MeirKriheli/rusmux) was created. It served as a chance for me to:

* Utilize the existing `.yml` project files from `tmuxinator`.
* Generate a standalone binary that can be easily distributed.
* Enhance my skills and comprehension of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and its associated tools.

## Example

```sh
cat ~/.config/rusmux/demo.yml
```

```yaml
project_name: demo  # can also use name
project_root: ~/src/demo
on_project_start:
  - sudo systemctl start postgresql
  - sudo systemctl start mysqld
# on_project_stop: 
pre_window:
  - workon demo
  - cd demo
windows:
  - editor: vim
  - shells:
      layout: main-vertical
      root: ~/src/demo/code  # Optional per window root overriding `project_root`
      options:  # per window options
        main-pane-width: 60%
      panes:
        - #
        - grunt serve
        - remote-log: # name is meaningless, for multi commands
          - ssh me@example.com
          - cd /var/logs
          - tail -f project.log 
  - mail: python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025

```

## Install

* Arch Linux users can install [rusmux from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rusmux),
  e.g. (using `paru`):

  ```sh
  paru -S rusmux
  ```

* Get a compiled binary from the
  [Releases](https://github.com/MeirKriheli/rusmux/releases) page and place it
  in your `$PATH`.

* With `cargo`:

  ```sh
  cargo install rusmux
  ```

* With shell script, for the specific version, see the [release page](https://github.com/MeirKriheli/rusmux/releases/latest/), e.g:

  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/MeirKriheli/rusmux/releases/download/v0.x.y/rusmux-installer.sh | sh
  ```



## Commands

* Run a project

  ```sh
  rusmux run [project]
  rusmux start [project]
  ```

* List all existing projects

  ```sh
  rusmux list
  ```
  
* Output shell commands for a project 

  ```sh
  rusmux debug [project]
  ```

* Edit an existing project (`$EDITOR` should be set)

  ```sh
  rusmux edit [project]
  ```

* Stop project's session

  ```sh
  rusmux stop [project]
  rusmux kill [project]
  ```

* Delete an existing project (after confirmation)

  ```sh
  rusmux delete [project]
  ```

* Create a new project, and open it in an editor (`$EDITOR` should be set)

  ```sh
  rusmux new [project]
  ```

  This creates the project from default template. To create one with just the
  project name:

  ```sh
  rusmux new [project] --blank
  ```

* Copy an existing project to a new one and edit it (`$EDITOR` should be set)

  ```sh
  rusmux copy [existing] [new]
  ```


* Check your environment for potential issues

  ```sh
  rusmux doctor
  ```

  Checks for `tmux` in `$PATH` and `$SHELL` & `$EDITOR` are set.


> **NOTE** In the commands above, `project`, `existing` and `new` can be:
>
> * A simple name, like `my_project`, `awesome_server`, which will be created with a `yaml` extension in the config directory.
> * A path to a file (determined by an extension and/or path separator), e.g. `~/projects/my_project/session.yaml`.
